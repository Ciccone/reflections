When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    Remote repositories are helpful if you would like to backup your work,
    collaborate with others, continue your work when away from your primary
    development machine, or to release code for public use and review.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually pulling from the remote repository ensures that local work (which
    you have not yet pushed to the remote) is not automatically overwritten
    by an updated remote. This can easily occur when working collaboratively.
    If a colleague pushes changes to the remote then you would have to safely
    merge those changes into any commits you've made on the branch locally.
