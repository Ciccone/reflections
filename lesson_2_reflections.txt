What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    There needs to be a directory and metadata files created in order to keep
    track of the commit history and which files are being tracked in a certain
    repository. The top folder of the repo contains:
    - A .git subfolder with all the git related revision history of your repo
    - A working tree, or checked out copies of your project files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area allows you to collect your thoughts when determining
    which files to track the changes of for each commit. It allows you to
    add/remove files from a repo for each commit. The working directory refers
    to the directory you were in when you called git init to create the repo.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
